#Part of the sufferings of Leicestershire & North-Hamptonshire by informers and priests also, God's mercies testified unto, and mans cruelty bore witness against : being a faithful demonstration given forth in the dread of the Lord, against the cruelty of persecution, as it hath of late been manifested, and notoriously acted by the priest and people of the town of Farthingstone in the county of North-Hampton to shame of their professed religion and to the injury of those who truly fear God and worship him : which may be as a prospect unto them, whereby they may behold themselves and consider the evil of their ways and be warned to timely repentence in this their day ... / W. Pooley.#
